Traffic signs detection is a computer vision project that aims to automatically identify and classify traffic signs in images or video frames. The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately recognize traffic signs and understand their meanings in order to assist with navigation and obey traffic regulations. This can be useful for autonomous vehicles, as well as for assisting human drivers. Traffic signs detection systems typically involve training a machine learning model on a large dataset of labeled traffic sign images, and then using the trained model to classify traffic signs in real-time video frames or images. The performance of a traffic signs detection system is typically evaluated based on its ability to accurately classify traffic signs, and to do so in a timely manner.
